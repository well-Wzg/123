This is a python desktop image processing application based on tkinter and opencv.
I have developed a range of captivating style filters and image processing features for this project, and I am excited for you to experience the productivity and enjoyment that they offer!

## Build instructions
The script main.py can be run directly after meeting the requirements in requirments.txt.


### Requirements
* Python 3.9
* Packages: listed in `requirements.txt` 
* Tested on Windows 10

### Build steps
* Use the pip tool to install the packages listed in reqiurement.txt. 
* Due to the large file size of the style transfer model, it cannot be submitted together. I have uploaded them to GitHub. To use the effects in StyleTransform, please go to this website: https://github.com/well-Wzg/ImageCraft.git. Download the files in the "models" folder and place them in the local "models" folder.
* Replace the initial file in the border folder with a border material of your choice (white background)



### Test steps
* Run `main.py`. After starting the program, it will automatically open the local file browser
* Observe if the image file is displayed properly after selection.
* Observe whether the functions that require external materials such as style migration, border, and pixelation can be executed normally.
* If the output is as expected, then the program is running correctly
