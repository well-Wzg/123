# User manual 

After running the program, the program will automatically open the local file browser. You need to select the image file you want to process, and then follow the prompts in the program to proceed.

##Shortcut Operations

Below are some operation prompts that you may need. Note that all operations are not case sensitive (If the shortcut keys are not responding, try minimizing the program and then restoring it to resolve the issue.):

* Crtl + O: Open a new file.
* Crtl + S: Open the file browser and save the current processed image file.
* Crtl + Z: Undo the current operation and go back to the previous state of the image.
* Crtl + Y: Redo the previously undone operation.
* Crtl + Q: Open a confirmation dialog to quit the program.
* Ctrl + R: Reset the current processed image to its initial state.
* Right-click: Open a panel of commonly used functions (currently including temporary storage of image and reset image function).


##Notes:

* In functions that require continuous input of parameters and real-time feedback, such as image rotation and scaling, the user should right-click to open the panel and click "done" to confirm the operation after editing. Otherwise, the operation will not take effect.
* Any unsaved operations will be lost if the program is exited halfway.
* The program's border function can be customized by replacing the materials in the "border" folder of the source program with a white background border file provided by the user.
